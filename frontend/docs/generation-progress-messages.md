# Generation Progress Messages

## Overview

Updated the generation progress widget to show more interesting and meaningful messages instead of technical terms like "Writing HTML" or "Writing CSS".

## Message Categories

## How It Works

1. **Random Selection**: Each time a message is needed, a random one is picked from the appropriate category
2. **File Type Detection**: Based on the file extension (.html, .css, .js), the appropriate category is selected
3. **Message Rotation**: Messages change every 3 seconds to keep things interesting
4. **Animated Dots**: Dots animate every 500ms to show activity

## User Experience

**Before:**
```
Writing HTML...
Writing CSS...
Writing JavaScript...
```

**After:**
```
Crafting the structure...
Painting with pixels...
Bringing it to life...
```

The messages rotate every 3 seconds, so users might see:
- "Building the foundation..." → "Assembling the framework..." → "Laying out the bones..."

## Benefits

✅ **More engaging** - Fun, creative messages instead of technical jargon
✅ **Less repetitive** - Random selection means variety
✅ **Better UX** - Users feel like something interesting is happening
✅ **Personality** - Adds character to the AI builder experience
✅ **Dynamic** - Messages change every 3 seconds for variety

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// Random message selection
function getRandomMessage(category: keyof typeof interestingMessages): string {
  const messages = interestingMessages[category];
  return messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
}

// Message rotation every 3 seconds
const messageInterval = setInterval(() => {
  setCurrentMessage(getGenerationMessage(generatingFiles));
}, 3000);
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- [ ] More message variations per category
- [ ] Context-aware messages based on user's request
- [ ] Progress percentage with messages
- [ ] Emoji support for extra personality
- [ ] Different message sets for different themes
