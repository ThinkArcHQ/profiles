## Testing Checklist

Test the agent with these prompts:

- [ ] "Create a minimalist dark theme profile page"
- [ ] "Build a glassmorphism profile with neon accents"
- [ ] "Make a brutalist design with bold typography"
- [ ] "Create a colorful gradient profile page"
- [ ] "Design a cyberpunk neon profile"

Expected behavior:
- ‚úÖ Uses createFile tool for each file
- ‚úÖ Sends brief progress messages
- ‚úÖ Generates complete HTML/CSS/JS
- ‚úÖ No code in chat messages
- ‚úÖ Responsive and accessible
- ‚úÖ Modern design techniques
- ‚úÖ No placeholders

## File Location

`frontend/src/lib/agent/code-generation-agent.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Test with various design requests
2. Monitor tool call patterns
3. Adjust prompt if needed
4. Add more examples if agent struggles
5. Fine-tune messaging style
