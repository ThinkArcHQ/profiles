# Task 7: Download Functionality Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented download functionality for the AI Profile Builder, allowing users to download all generated files as a ZIP archive or individual files.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Download Utility Functions (`src/lib/utils/download-utils.ts`)
- **`downloadFilesAsZip()`**: Downloads all generated files as a ZIP archive
  - Uses JSZip library to create ZIP files
  - Maintains proper folder structure
  - Handles blob creation and download trigger
  - Includes error handling
  
- **`downloadSingleFile()`**: Downloads a single file
  - Creates blob from file content
  - Triggers browser download
  - Cleans up resources after download

### 2. Preview Panel Updates (`src/components/build/preview-panel.tsx`)
- Added "Download All" button in the header
- Button appears only when files are generated
- Shows loading state during download ("Downloading...")
- Includes error handling with user feedback
- Uses Tabler Icons for download icon
- Properly styled with primary button styling

### 3. Code Editor (Already Existed)
- Individual file download button already implemented
- Located in the code editor header
- Downloads single file with proper filename

## Dependencies Added
- **jszip**: ^3.10.1 - For creating ZIP archives
- **@types/jszip**: ^3.4.1 - TypeScript definitions

## Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests in `src/lib/utils/__tests__/download-utils.test.ts`
- Tests cover:
  - Downloading multiple files as ZIP
  - Error handling for empty file arrays
  - Single file downloads
  - DOM manipulation and cleanup
- All tests passing ✅

## User Experience
1. User generates profile page code through AI chat
2. Files appear in the preview panel
3. User can:
   - Click "Download All" to get all files as `profile-page.zip`
   - Click individual file's "Download" button to get single file
4. Download happens instantly with proper folder structure maintained

## Requirements Met
✅ Implement download all as ZIP
✅ Use JSZip library
✅ Include all generated files
✅ Proper folder structure
✅ Requirements: 3.5

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ `frontend/src/lib/utils/download-utils.ts` (new)
- ✅ `frontend/src/lib/utils/__tests__/download-utils.test.ts` (new)
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/build/preview-panel.tsx` (modified)
- ✅ `frontend/package.json` (dependencies added)

## Next Steps
The download functionality is complete and ready for use. Users can now:
- Download all generated files as a single ZIP archive
- Download individual files from the code editor
- Get proper folder structure in the ZIP file
