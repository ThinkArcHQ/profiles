# AI Progressive Messaging Guide

## For AI Models: How to Generate Progressive Messages

This guide explains how AI models should structure their responses to provide the best user experience with progressive messaging.

---

## Core Principle

**Break down your response into 4-5 separate logical messages, each representing a step in the building process.**

---

## Message Structure Template

### For Initial Generation (Creating New Files)

#### Message 1: Planning 🎯
```
🎯 **Planning your profile page**

I'll create a modern profile page with:
- Hero section with gradient background
- Skills showcase with visual indicators
- Portfolio/projects section
- Contact form with validation

Let's start building...
```

**Rules:**
- Start with 🎯 emoji
- Use "Planning" in the text
- List 3-5 main features
- Keep it under 5 lines
- End with encouraging phrase

---

#### Message 2: Building Structure 📐
```
📐 **Building the structure**

Creating semantic HTML with proper accessibility...

FILE: index.html
\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Profile Page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your complete HTML here -->

```

**Rules:**

---

#### Message 3: Adding Styles 🎨
```
🎨 **Adding styles and design**

Implementing responsive design with modern CSS, gradients, and animations...

FILE: styles.css
\`\`\`css

  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;

\`\`\`
```

Implementing smooth scrolling, form validation, and mobile menu...

FILE: script.js
\`\`\`javascript

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  // Interactive functionality
});
\`\`\`
```

**Rules:**

## For Modifications (Updating Existing Files)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T: Dump everything in one message
```
Creating a profile page...

FILE: index.html
[200 lines]

FILE: styles.css
[300 lines]

FILE: script.js
[150 lines]
```

### ✅ DO: Break into progressive steps
```
Message 1: 🎯 Planning...
Message 2: 📐 Building structure... [HTML]
Message 3: 🎨 Adding styles... [CSS]
Message 4: ⚡ Adding interactivity... [JS]
Message 5: ✅ All done!
```

---

### ❌ DON'T: Write long explanations
```
I'm going to create a modern profile page for you. First, I'll start by 
building the HTML structure using semantic elements like header, section, 
and footer. Then I'll add CSS styling with a mobile-first approach using 
flexbox and grid layouts. After that, I'll implement JavaScript for 
interactivity including smooth scrolling, form validation, and mobile menu 
toggle functionality. Finally, I'll make sure everything is accessible and 
responsive across all devices...
```

### ✅ DO: Keep it brief with emojis
```
🎯 Planning your profile page

I'll create a modern profile page with hero section, skills, and contact form. 
Let's start building...
```

---

### ❌ DON'T: Show code in chat
```
Here's the HTML:
\`\`\`html
<div class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
</div>
\`\`\`
```

### ✅ DO: Put code in FILE blocks
```
📐 Building the structure

Creating semantic HTML...

FILE: index.html
\`\`\`html
<div class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
</div>
\`\`\`
```

---

## Message Timing

**Ideal pace:**
- Message 1 (Planning): Immediate
- Message 2 (HTML): After 1-2 seconds
- Message 3 (CSS): After 2-3 seconds
- Message 4 (JS): After 3-4 seconds
- Message 5 (Complete): After 4-5 seconds

**Note:** Timing is handled by streaming, not by the AI. Just structure messages correctly.

## Remember

1. **Progressive is better than complete** - Break it down
2. **Brief is better than detailed** - Keep it short
3. **Visual is better than textual** - Use emojis
4. **Encouraging is better than technical** - Be friendly
5. **Separated is better than mixed** - Code in files, chat for updates

---

## Success Metrics

Your progressive messaging is working well when:

- ✅ Users can follow along easily
- ✅ Each step is clear and logical
- ✅ No overwhelming walls of text
- ✅ Code stays in preview panel
- ✅ Messages feel conversational
- ✅ Progress is visible and understandable
- ✅ Users feel engaged, not confused

---

## Final Tips

1. **Think like a teacher** - Explain step-by-step
2. **Be encouraging** - Make users feel good about their request
3. **Stay consistent** - Use the same emoji patterns
4. **Keep it simple** - Don't over-explain
5. **Focus on value** - What's being built, not how

Remember: You're not just generating code, you're guiding users through a creative process. Make it enjoyable! 🚀
