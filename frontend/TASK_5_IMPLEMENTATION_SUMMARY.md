# Task 5 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the preview panel with toggle functionality for the AI Profile Builder interface.

## Components Created

### 1. PreviewPanel (`/components/build/preview-panel.tsx`)
- Main container component that manages the preview panel
- Toggle buttons for switching between Code and Preview modes
- Responsive layout with file tree sidebar and content area
- Handles empty state when no files are generated
- **Requirements met**: 3.1, 3.2

### 2. FileTree (`/components/build/file-tree.tsx`)
- Displays hierarchical file structure
- Highlights the currently active file
- File selection handling with click events
- Visual file type indicators (emojis for different file types)
- Shows generation status for files being created
- Supports nested folder structures
- **Requirements met**: 3.1

### 3. CodeEditor (`/components/build/code-editor.tsx`)
- Syntax highlighting using `react-syntax-highlighter`
- Supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and TSX
- Copy to clipboard functionality with visual feedback
- Download individual file functionality
- File header showing file path and status
- Dark theme (VS Code Dark Plus) for better readability
- **Requirements met**: 3.2, 3.3

### 4. LivePreview (`/components/build/live-preview.tsx`)
- Renders generated HTML/CSS/JS in a sandboxed iframe
- Security features:
  - Disabled dangerous APIs (eval, Function constructor)
  - Sandbox attribute with restricted permissions
  - Error boundary for catching rendering errors
- Manual refresh button with loading state
- Error display with dismissible notifications
- Combines multiple CSS and JS files into single preview
- Handles missing HTML files gracefully
- **Requirements met**: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4

## Integration

Updated `BuildPageClient` to use the new `PreviewPanel` component, replacing the previous placeholder implementation. The component receives:
- `files`: Array of generated files
- `activeFile`: Currently selected file path
- `previewMode`: Current view mode ('code' or 'preview')
- `onFileSelect`: Callback for file selection
- `onModeChange`: Callback for mode switching

## Dependencies Added
- `react-syntax-highlighter`: For code syntax highlighting
- `@types/react-syntax-highlighter`: TypeScript definitions

## Testing
Added sample files to the build page for testing:
- `index.html`: Sample profile page structure
- `styles.css`: Styling with gradient background
- `script.js`: Interactive JavaScript features

These can be removed once the API integration (Task 4) is complete.

## Next Steps
The preview panel is now ready for integration with:

- Task 7: Download all as ZIP functionality
- Task 8: Iterative refinement (will update files in real-time)

## Verification
All subtasks completed:
- ✅ 5.1 Create preview panel container
- ✅ 5.2 Build file tree component
- ✅ 5.3 Create code editor component
- ✅ 5.4 Build live preview iframe

Build successful with no TypeScript errors.
