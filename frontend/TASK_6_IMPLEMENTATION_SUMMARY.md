# Task 6 Implementation Summary: Code Streaming and Display

## Overview
Implemented real-time code streaming and file state management for the AI Profile Builder. The system now parses streamed AI responses, extracts code blocks, and updates the file list in real-time with visual progress indicators.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Code Parser Utility (`src/lib/utils/code-parser.ts`)
**Purpose**: Parse code blocks from AI-generated markdown responses

**Key Functions**:
- `parseCodeBlocks(text)`: Extracts code blocks with file paths and languages
  - Supports format: ` ```language:path ` or ` ```language `
  - Tracks completion status (complete vs. streaming)
  - Infers file paths from language when not specified

- `getLanguageFromPath(path)`: Determines syntax highlighting language from file extension

- `mergeCodeBlocks(existing, new)`: Intelligently merges new code blocks with existing files
  - Updates existing files
  - Adds new files
  - Handles partial/streaming content

**Test Coverage**: 13 tests covering all parsing scenarios

### 2. File State Management Hook (`src/hooks/use-file-state.ts`)
**Purpose**: Centralized state management for generated files

**State Tracked**:
- `files`: Array of generated files with content and metadata
- `activeFile`: Currently selected file path
- `generatingFiles`: Set of file paths currently being generated

**Actions Provided**:
- `addFile(file)`: Add or update a file
- `updateFile(path, content, isComplete)`: Update file content during streaming
- `setActiveFile(path)`: Change active file selection
- `clearFiles()`: Reset all files
- `markFileComplete(path)`: Mark a file as fully generated
- `markAllFilesComplete()`: Mark all files as complete
- `getFile(path)`: Retrieve a specific file

**Features**:
- Automatic active file selection (first file added)
- Tracks generation status per file
- Infers language from file extension

**Test Coverage**: 10 tests covering all state operations

### 3. Generation Progress Component (`src/components/build/generation-progress.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Visual indicator for ongoing code generation

**Features**:
- Animated spinner
- File count display
- Animated dots for visual feedback
- Only shows when generation is active

**Design**:
- Muted background with border
- Primary color accents
- Responsive text sizing

### 4. Updated Build Client (`src/app/(dashboard)/build/client.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Main page component with streaming integration

**Key Changes**:
- Integrated `useFileState` hook for file management
- Implemented streaming response handler
  - Parses Vercel AI SDK data stream format
  - Updates files in real-time as chunks arrive
  - Updates UI with streaming message content
  
- File upload processing
  - Converts images to base64
  - Handles PDFs (placeholder for text extraction)
  
- Error handling
  - Network failures
  - API errors
  - Streaming interruptions

**Streaming Flow**:
1. User sends message with optional files
2. Create placeholder assistant message
3. Stream response from `/api/generate`
4. Parse data chunks (format: `0:"text"`)
5. Extract code blocks from accumulated content
6. Update file state in real-time
7. Mark files complete when streaming ends
8. Add to conversation history

### 5. Enhanced File Tree (`src/components/build/file-tree.tsx`)
**Purpose**: Display file hierarchy with generation status

**Updates**:
- Added "Generating..." indicator for files being created
- Pulsing dot animation for visual feedback
- Primary color for generating files (vs. muted for complete)

## Technical Details

### Streaming Protocol
The implementation handles Vercel AI SDK's streaming format:
```
0:"text chunk 1"
0:"text chunk 2"
...
```

Each line starting with `0:` contains a JSON-encoded text chunk that's accumulated and parsed for code blocks.

### Code Block Format
Supports two markdown code block formats:

1. **With file path**:
   ````markdown
   ```html:index.html
   <h1>Hello</h1>
   ```
   ````

2. **Without file path** (inferred):
   ````markdown
   ```html
   <h1>Hello</h1>
   ```
   ````

### File State Updates
Files are updated incrementally during streaming:
- Incomplete blocks update existing content
- Complete blocks (ending with ` ``` `) finalize the file
- Multiple files can be generated simultaneously
- Each file tracks its own generation status

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 1.3: Real-time Streaming
✅ AI responses stream in real-time
✅ UI updates incrementally as code generates
✅ Visual progress indicators show generation status

### Requirement 1.4: File List Updates
✅ Files appear in tree as they're generated
✅ Content updates in real-time during streaming
✅ Generation status tracked per file

### Requirement 3.1: File Tree Display
✅ Hierarchical file structure
✅ Generation status indicators
✅ Active file highlighting

### Requirement 3.2: Code Display
✅ Syntax-highlighted code editor
✅ Real-time content updates
✅ File selection and navigation

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Code Parser**: 13 tests, 100% pass rate
  - Single/multiple code blocks
  - Complete/incomplete blocks
  - File path inference
  - Language detection
  - Block merging

- **File State Hook**: 10 tests, 100% pass rate
  - State initialization
  - File CRUD operations
  - Generation tracking
  - Active file management

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run code parser tests
npm run test:run -- src/lib/utils/__tests__/code-parser.test.ts

# Run file state tests
npm run test:run -- src/hooks/__tests__/use-file-state.test.ts
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Real-time Feedback**
   - Users see code appear as it's generated
   - No waiting for complete response
   - Progress indicators show activity

2. **Visual Indicators**
   - Pulsing dots in generation progress
   - "Generating..." labels on files
   - Animated spinner during generation

3. **Smooth Updates**
   - Incremental file updates
   - Auto-scroll in message list
   - Automatic active file selection

## Future Enhancements

1. **Progress Percentage**: Show completion percentage per file
2. **Estimated Time**: Display estimated time remaining
3. **Pause/Resume**: Allow pausing generation
4. **Retry Failed Files**: Retry individual file generation
5. **Diff View**: Show changes between iterations
