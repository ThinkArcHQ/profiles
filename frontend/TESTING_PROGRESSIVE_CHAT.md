# Testing Progressive Chat UX

## Quick Start

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to the build page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/build
   ```

3. **Test the progressive messaging:**

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Initial Profile Generation

**Input:**
```
Create a modern profile page with hero section, skills showcase, and contact form
```

**Expected Output (5 progressive messages):**

1. **üéØ Planning** (Blue accent)
   - Brief overview of what will be created
   - Lists main sections

2. **üìê Building Structure** (Purple accent)
   - "Creating semantic HTML..."
   - HTML code appears in preview panel

3. **üé® Adding Styles** (Pink accent)
   - "Implementing responsive design..."
   - CSS code appears in preview panel

4. **‚ö° Adding Interactivity** (Yellow accent)
   - "Implementing smooth scrolling..."
   - JavaScript code appears in preview panel

5. **‚úÖ Completion** (Green accent)
   - Summary of what was created
   - Next steps

**Verify:**
- [ ] Messages appear progressively (not all at once)
- [ ] Each message has correct color accent
- [ ] Emojis display correctly
- [ ] Code appears in preview panel, not chat
- [ ] Messages are brief (1-3 sentences)

1. **üîç Analyzing** (Orange accent)
   - "I'll update the button color..."

2. **üîß Updating** (Orange accent)
   - "Updating button styles..."
   - SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in preview

3. **‚úÖ Updated** (Green accent)
   - "Button color changed to blue!"

**Verify:**
- [ ] Modification uses SEARCH/REPLACE format
- [ ] Messages are brief and clear
- [ ] Color coding works correctly
- [ ] Preview updates in real-time

---

### Test 3: Complex Request

**Input:**
```
Add a portfolio section with 3 project cards, each with an image, title, description, and link
```

1. **üéØ Planning**
   - Overview of portfolio section

2. **üìê Building Structure**
   - HTML for portfolio section

3. **üé® Adding Styles**
   - CSS for project cards

4. **‚ö° Adding Interactivity** (if needed)
   - Hover effects, animations

5. **‚úÖ Completion**
   - Summary

**Verify:**
- [ ] Complex requests still use progressive messaging
- [ ] Each step is clear and logical
- [ ] Code is properly organized

---

### Test 4: With Image Upload

**Input:**
1. Upload an image (design mockup or reference)
2. Type: "Create a profile page based on this design"

**Expected Output:**

1. **üéØ Planning**
   - "Analyzing your design..."
   - Lists elements from the image

2. **üìê Building Structure**
   - HTML matching the design

3. **üé® Adding Styles**
   - CSS matching colors/layout from image

4. **‚úÖ Completion**
   - Summary

**Verify:**
- [ ] AI acknowledges the uploaded image
- [ ] Design elements from image are incorporated
- [ ] Progressive messaging still works with files

---

### Test 5: Multiple Modifications

**Input (sequence):**
1. "Create a simple profile page"
2. "Add a skills section"
3. "Change the color scheme to orange"
4. "Add smooth scroll animations"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each request should trigger 2-3 progressive messages
- Modifications should use SEARCH/REPLACE format
- Color coding should be consistent
- Chat history should be maintained

**Verify:**
- [ ] Each modification is handled separately
- [ ] Context is maintained across requests
- [ ] SEARCH/REPLACE works correctly
- [ ] No duplicate code generation

## Performance Testing

### Streaming
1. **Test slow network:**
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Throttling ‚Üí Slow 3G
   - Send a request
   - Verify messages still stream progressively

2. **Test fast network:**
   - Normal network speed
   - Verify messages don't appear too fast to read

### Error Handling
1. **Test API error:**
   - Stop the API server
   - Send a request
   - Verify error message displays correctly

2. **Test invalid input:**
   - Send empty message
   - Verify validation works

---

## Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

**Check:**
- Emoji rendering
- Color gradients
- Animations
- Responsive layout

---

## Accessibility Testing

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - [ ] Can tab through messages
   - [ ] Can focus on input
   - [ ] Can submit with Enter

2. **Screen Reader:**
   - [ ] Messages are announced
   - [ ] Emojis have proper labels
   - [ ] Progress updates are announced

3. **Color Contrast:**
   - [ ] Text is readable on all backgrounds
   - [ ] Color coding doesn't rely solely on color
   - [ ] Emojis provide additional context

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Messages appear all at once
**Solution:** Check that streaming is working correctly in the API route

### Issue: Wrong color coding
**Solution:** Verify emoji detection in `getMessageType()` function

### Issue: Code appears in chat
**Solution:** Check `sanitizeMessageForDisplay()` function

### Issue: Emojis don't render
**Solution:** Ensure UTF-8 encoding is set correctly

### Issue: Messages too long
**Solution:** AI needs to follow the system prompt better - may need to adjust prompt

---

## Success Criteria

The progressive chat UX is working correctly when:

1. ‚úÖ Messages appear step-by-step, not all at once
2. ‚úÖ Each message type has correct color coding
3. ‚úÖ Emojis display and provide visual clarity
4. ‚úÖ Code stays in preview panel, not chat
5. ‚úÖ Messages are brief and conversational
6. ‚úÖ Progress is clear and understandable
7. ‚úÖ User experience feels engaging and friendly
8. ‚úÖ No overwhelming walls of text
9. ‚úÖ Real-time updates work smoothly
10. ‚úÖ Works across all browsers and devices

---

## Feedback Collection

After testing, gather feedback on:

1. **Clarity:** Are the progressive steps clear?
2. **Timing:** Do messages appear at the right pace?
3. **Visual Design:** Are colors and emojis helpful?
4. **Engagement:** Does it feel more engaging than before?
5. **Understanding:** Is it easier to understand what's happening?

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. Collect user feedback
2. Adjust timing if needed
3. Fine-tune color schemes
4. Add more message types if needed
5. Consider adding progress bars
6. Implement step navigation
7. Add undo/redo functionality

---

## Notes

- The AI model needs to follow the system prompt correctly for progressive messaging to work
- If messages aren't progressive, check the system prompt in `profile-generator.ts`
- Streaming must be working for real-time updates
- Color detection is based on emojis and keywords
